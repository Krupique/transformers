# Mastering Transformers: Building the Attention Mechanism Step by Step


This project is a hands-on exploration of the Transformer model, one of the most powerful and versatile architectures in modern artificial intelligence. The goal of the project is to guide you through the process of building a Transformer model from scratch, focusing specifically on one of its key components: the attention mechanism, particularly the attention mask.  

In the beginning, we discuss the theory behind Transformers, explaining how the model works (you can read the article here: [A Deep Dive into Transformers Architecture](https://medium.com/@krupck/a-deep-dive-into-transformers-architecture-58fed326b08d)), including the mathematical foundations of the attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence depending on their relevance to the current task. The attention mask plays a crucial role here, helping the model to ignore irrelevant or future tokens in tasks like sequence generation and translation.

Next, we move on to the practical implementation of the Transformer model. We start by building the embedding layer, which transforms input sequences into fixed-size vectors. Then, we dive into the attention mechanism itself, implementing the scaled dot-product attention and creating the attention mask to ensure the model focuses on the correct parts of the sequence. This mask is crucial for controlling which tokens should be attended to, particularly in tasks where certain information must be hidden or ignored.

Finally, we implement the output layers, including a linear transformation followed by a softmax function, to make predictions based on the attention-processed input data. By the end of the project, youâ€™ll have a deeper understanding of how Transformers work, especially how the attention mechanism and its mask allow the model to process sequences effectively and adapt to complex tasks.  

This project serves as a foundation for anyone looking to explore Transformer models in more depth and apply them to real-world problems such as natural language processing, machine translation, and other sequential tasks.
